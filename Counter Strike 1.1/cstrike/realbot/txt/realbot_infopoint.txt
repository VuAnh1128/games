1 	WHAT ARE INFO-POINTS?
-----------------------------
Info-Points are certain positions in a map, which represent a sort of waypoint to let a bot
perform a certain action when its near such an info-point. As example, a JUMP info-point 
will make the bot jump when it gets near such an info-point. 

In Beta 1, the bot currently learns 2 Info-Points by itself:
- > The JUMP info-point
- > The DUCK info-point

The Global Waypoint System excists of MOVE info-points.

--------------------------------------------------
2	WHAT DOES THE GLOBAL WAYPOINT SYSTEM MEAN?
--------------------------------------------------
RealBot is an unwaypointed bot, however, to get maximum performance , it is always handy
to let a bot know for sure where it could move to. This makes the bot look more smarter
and will let the rounds end quicker. However, the bots will be more predictable.

At the moment, i'm busy to balance the Navigation of RealBot FTR 1 and a simple Waypoint
system. If a bot finds an Info-Point MOVE, then it will move to it. If not, then it will
move using its own Navigation System. The idea is, to merge the two. To get an unpredictable
, yet , good enough Navigation. You have to place the MOVE info-points manually.


------------------------------
3	HOW TO OPTIMIZE A MAP?
------------------------------
Ok, the current navigation code for the MOVE info-points is pretty primitive. You should only
place the MOVE info-points VERY globaly. Meaning, only on specific spots where the bot should
pay extra attention to. You can easily add Info-Points. There is NO remove option YET.
You can place the info-points at ANY time. To place an info-point:

Press N to bring the Menu.
Choose 2 (Info-Point Menu)
Choose 1 (Add info-point)
Choose 1 (Add MOVE waypoint)

An info-point is added, its not visible, but its there for sure! 
You can spawn a bot to check if the map works better now, if not, just clear the memory and
place the info-points again. 

Again, DON'T place TO MANY info-points to close at each other. This will confuse the bot.

No official Support for this issue in Beta 1. Its still primitive. All RBL files you send are accepted
but please test them 200% before you send them. Only send RBL files which have MOVE info-points.
Since RealBot auto-generates for EACH map a RBL file, but not spawns MOVE info-points on its own.
