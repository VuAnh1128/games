RealGamer's RealBot Beta 2 Manual
---------------------------------
(This manual is not 100% finished, read the REALBOT_FOR_DUMMIES.TXT for any questions)
(For those who have CS 6.5 or CS 6.6, read almost below how to set RealBot for CS 6.x)

-----------
WHAT'S NEW?
-----------
Mostly bugfixes, tweaks, and more info-points supported! More optimized maps
and more! Read the readme.txt for a list!


-----------------------
HOW TO BEGIN A LAN GAME
-----------------------
You can play with RealBot on an own created LAN game, or INTERNET game.
To create a lan game, click on PLAY CS, then MULTIPLAYER, CREATE LAN.
After that set the max players you want to be able to play, the map and
set the timelimit, or freezetime. Its suggested to set the timelimit to
0. (the timelimit and freezetime are in the ADVANCED section). Then click
on OK. 

------------------------
HOW TO PLAY WITH REALBOT
------------------------
In this version you can add bots using the Menu. Press N to bring up the menu. 
Now select Option 1 (Add RealBot), you will be able to add a RANDOM bot or a
SPECIFIED bot. Press 1 to add a bot , auto-teambalanced and random model and
random skill + name. Else, choose SPECIFIED to specify its Skill and Team.

You can also add bots through console:

  THROUGH CONSOLE:

Create lan/internet game (read above), then bring down the console using
the ~ key. If it doesnt show up , read the REALBOT_FOR_DUMMIES.txt how
make it appear. To add a bot, you use the ADDBOT command, the full syntax
is:

ADDBOT <team> <model> <name> <skill>

You DON'T have to fill in the sections if you just want to add a bot. When
leaving everything open. The bot will choose the team with less players 
(will equal teams automaticly!), random model, random name and <skill> will
be equal to BOTSKILL variable which is standard -1 (RANDOM). 

Valid teams are:
1 - Terrorist
2 - Counter
5 - Auto

Valid models are:
1, 2, 3, 4 - Model of team
5 - Auto

Valid names:
Any name you like! 

Valid skill:
1 through 50. 
1  = Hard
50 = Easy
-1 = RANDOM (will pick a random skill)


Example 1, Add bot with EVERYTHING random:

ADDBOT

Example 2, Add bot assigned to Terror only, rest is random

ADDBOT 1

Example 3, Add a bot to random model, team, own name, own skill (32)

ADDBOT 5 5 "MyBot" 32


--------------------------------------
HOW TO KICK/REMOVE A BOT FROM THE GAME
--------------------------------------
Use the console command rb_removebot <amount> <team>

rb_removebot 1 1 
will kick 1 bot of team 1 (= Terror)
rb_removebot 1 2
will kick 1 bot of team 2 (= Counter)
NO team specified will randomly kick bots.

Manner 2:

Use KICK, e.g.: You want to kick a bot named UrDead

KICK "UrDead"




------------------------------------------
HOW TO ADD A LOT OF BOTS TO THE SAME TEAM.
(SIMULATE A 1HUMAN VS 10 BOTS)
------------------------------------------
NEW: Using the Menu, press N (brings menu) and press 3 to get all bots
against you. This only works if you haven't added bots yet. Else it will
auto-balance the teams. Or even give you all the bots. Be sure though you
have set the mp_autoteambalance to 0.


...THROUGH CONSOLE....
There are several ways to do this:

BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING, BE SURE MP_AUTOTEAMBALANCE is 0!

The bot.cfg has automaticly SET this flag to 0. You don't have
to do anything if didnt change the bot.cfg.

MANNER 1:

Do not join a team, instead, add bots to the specific team you want
to fight against. Then join the opposite team. All bots should be
assigned to the team you want to fight against then. Example:
(you want to be CT , all bots T, maxplayers is 8)

Type this in console 7 times (to repeat faster, press UP after the
first typed command)

ADDBOT 1

Mostly, 3 bots joined the Terrorist, rest is UNASSIGNED. Now YOU join
the Counter-Terrorists, all UNASSIGNED bots should be in the Terrors


MANNER 2:

Here is an other manner. 
Join the team you want to play in, now add bots to the opposite team.
Probably 3 join, rest is unnassigned, now kick 1 bot. All other
UNNASSIGNED bots should join the opposite team. The one you have kicked 
could be re-added using the same command, but not 100% sure it will join 
the other team again: Example:
(max players is 8, you CT, want to add 7 bots to T)

Join CT,

Type in console 7 times:

ADDBOT 1

Now you have to kick one bot, pick a name and kick him. E.g. name is UrDead

KICK "UrDead"

All UNASSIGNED bots should join the terror force now.

Try to re-add the bot

ADDBOT 1

MANNER 3 (by Markku Pitkänen)

This manner is more easier than Manner 1 and Manner 2. 
Type in console:

mp_limitteams 7

now addbots to the team you want to play against. Some bots get in the unassigned
part. Then type:

sv_restartround 1

And you should fight aginst them.


--------------------------------------------
HOW TO LET ALL BOTS BE AUTOMATICLY SKILL ### 
--------------------------------------------
In BOT.CFG a command is passed: BOTSKILL -1
This sets the default skill to -1, which means RANDOM.
All bots that are added, and didnt get a special parameter for <skill> 
will get the default skill. 

To change the botskill, type:

BOTSKILL <defaultskill>

the skill ranges from 1, till 50. 
1  = Very good
50 = Very bad

Skill affects behaviour on flashbangs, team work, radio, reaction time
buying stuff and aiming.

Its now possible to set the Ranges!
You can set the Random Ranges by using:

rb_minskill <value>
rb_maxskill <value>

You can't have a higher minskill than maxskill and otherwhise. The maxskill
cannot go higher than 50 and the minskill not lower than 1. Example to set
ranges from 1-30

rb_minskill 1
rb_maxskill 30


Manner 2:
Add bots, then type in console
RB_FORCESKILL ### 
all bots will be skill ### then (and never change, unless you set it to -1)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
I HAVE COUNTER-STRIKE BETA 6.5 (OR 6.6 OR 7.0), HOW TO SET REALBOT?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This command used to be bot_beta7, but since CS v1.0 is out, i've made a new
command called RB_PLAYINGCS <value> Here are the settings

Value			CS Version
0			Version 1.0
1			Beta 7.x
2			Beta 6.5 or Beta 6.6


So, to make them play CS 6.6

you have to type:

rb_playingcs 2


---------------------------------------------
TO WHICH RADIO COMMANDS DO THE BOT LISTEN TO?
---------------------------------------------
They listen to:

FOLLOW ME: Bot will follow (if found you) for 60 secs

NEED BACKUP: Bot will try to search for you 10 secs, when found
             it will backup you.

TAKING FIRE NEED ASSISTANCE: Same as NEED BACKUP

YOU TAKE THE POINT: Bot will stop following you.

TEAM FALL BACK: Bots will be more cautious. 
                NEW : Bots will retreat

GO GO GO: The bots will chase the goal entity, this might
          be handy when you see bots are walking the wrong
          way, just say GO GO GO, and the bots will check
          it out.  They will NOT follow anyone then.
	  NEW: Will stop camping

Note: Some bots don't react , or some bots say Negative!
      Bots reaction is based upon skills.

The listening code , came from Ditlew (NNBOT), i expanded and 
fixed the code for RealBot. Thanks Ditlew!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
I CAN'T ADD MORE THAN 4 PLAYERS, ALTHOUGH I SET THE MAXPLAYERS TO ###!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok, try this, it works most of the time, unless you don't have enough
HD space.

Edit the shortcut of counter-strike, and change the command line into:
(assuming you didnt change anything, else, just add what is different
compared to yours).

hl.exe -game cstrike -console -heapsize 32000

Where heapsize nr is the amount of RAM. It is adviced to take 50% of
the RAM you have. So if your computer has 64MB, 32000 is the heapsize:

Table:
MB	Heapsize
64	32000
128	64000
192	96000
etc.	etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
CAN I ADD CHAT INSULT SENTENCES? (thanks to Botman for this code)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
YES! Edit RB_INSULT.TXT , add your sentences or modify the original
ones. Max is 100 chat sentences in total. Maximum length each sentence
is 80 characters. A %n means the name of the killed bot. E.g.

A bot called "UrDead" kills a bot named "MeDies", the following sentence
would look like:

IN RB_INSULT.TXT:
Well %n, i got ya!

In Half-Life Using RealBot
UrDead :  Well MeDies, i got ya!

If you have a lot of sentences added, you can send the txt file to me.
I might add them to the original releases then. 

Thanks Botman!

------------------------------------------------------
CAN I ADD MY OWN RANDOM NAMES TO THE REALBOT DATABASE?
------------------------------------------------------
YES! Thanks to botmans CHAT code, i could add the same sort of
code for names! All names are listed in RB_NAMES.TXT, max length
of name is 25 characters! Max names is 100!


--------------------------------------------------------
CAN I STILL PLAY ON THE INTERNET WITH REALBOT INSTALLED?
--------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you are still able to play on the internet. Realbot
only affects HL when you CREATE a game. Not when you JOIN
a game.


-------------------------------------------------
I WANT TO USE/TRY AN OTHER BOT, WHAT SHOULD I DO?
-------------------------------------------------
Just install the other bot, RealBot has its own folder so nothing
will harm RB in any way.


------------------------------
I WANT TO DELETE REALBOT, HOW?
------------------------------
Delete the RealBot folder. Then delete liblist.gam
rename the old_liblist.gam into liblist.gam (to set back the original
CS liblist.gam) and you've deleted RB for good.

-------------------------------------
I WANT TO TEMPORARILY DISABLE REALBOT
-------------------------------------
Rename the liblist.gam and old_liblist.gam. So for instance;

1. Rename liblist.gam into rb_liblist.gam
2. Rename old_liblist.gam into liblist.gam

--------------------------
I WANT TO ENABLE IT AGAIN!
--------------------------
Reverse:

1. Rename liblist.gam into old_liblist.gam
2. Rename rb_liblist.gam into liblist.gam
