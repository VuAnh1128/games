RealBot Console Commands
------------------------
The following commands are RealBot specific.

rb_endround
===========
Ends the round by letting all bots suicide (like End Round option in MENU)

rb_removebot <amount> <team>
===========================
Will remove <amount> bots of the game of <team>. If <team> is not specified
then the last added bots will be removed. Else RealBot will pick a random team,
note that this can be a team without bots and so no bot will be kicked. Its recommended
to specify value AND team.

Team Values:
1		Terror
2		Counter

rb_playincs <value>    (was bot_beta7) <NEW>
===================
This variable sets which version of CS you are playing.
Value determines version of CS.

Value			CS Version
0			Version 1.0
1			Beta 7.x
2			Beta 6.5 or Beta 6.6

This only affects the bots behaviour for buying weapons (else you get weird
errors and such coming up with bots wanting to buy things that can't be bought).


rb_init                           <WAS REALBOT_INIT>
=======
Clears Info-Point database.

rb_freeze <value>
=================
0) Bots move
1) Bots will freeze (easy target)

rb_help
=======
Will give you a small list of the most used and effective realbot
specific console commands.


rb_minskill <value>
===================
<value> should be the minimum skill that can be choosen when you
want a random skill added to the bot. The normal boundries are
1-50, using this command you can set it so, that bots won't get
a lower skill than 20.

Example (no bot can have a skill of 20 or lower):

rb_minskill 20


rb_maxskill <value>
===================
This does the same as rb_minskill, except it sets the maximum.
This way, you can have bots with not a higher skill than 40.
(note: the higher, the worse the bot fights, the lower the skill value
the better the bot fights).

To set up a max of 40:

rb_maxskill 40

In total, if you want bots with a random skill between 20 and 40, type:

rb_minskill 20 
<press ENTER>
rb_maxskill 40
<press ENTER>


rb_addinfopoint <infopointtype> <parameter>
=========================================
Adds an infopoint of the specific type. Read realbot_infopoint.txt for
more information about infopoint types. Remember, only use the second
parameter if you use infopoint type 5. 

Example 1: Add infopoint type number 6 (sniper waypoint)

rb_addinfopoint 6

Example 2: Add infopoint location information (type 5)

rb_addinfopoint 5 "the garagedoor"



rb_dontshoot <value>
====================
Standard value is 0, determines if bots should start shooting at 
enemies or not. Set value to 1 if you want to practice against bots
who don't shoot at you. For example, to train as a sniper.


rb_save
=======
Type this to save the learned data at that moment.


rb_autosave <value>
===================
Standard is 0 (true), if value is 0, then it will save the learned
data every round. Set to 1, to let the bot just learn for the moment
but not to save it into a file. (use rb_save to save it anywayz, or
set the rb_autosave back to 0 to let it save every round again).
