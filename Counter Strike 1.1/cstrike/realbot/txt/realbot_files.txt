MAPS\

*.RBL			- OPTIMIZED FILES.

NOTE: These files contain the info-point MOVE. RealBot auto-generates
an RBL file of every map, to save its learned data. However, you need
to implement the waypoints by yourself. If you want to. The files above
contain the waypoints for the Global Waypoint System.
