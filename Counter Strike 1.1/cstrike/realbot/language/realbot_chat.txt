NOTE: In Beta 2.0 there are folders with <LANGUAGE><NR> these are a slightly different
translations of the language. Also some have new insults, some dont. So choose the one
you like the most.

To use the language, overwrite the rb_insults file in the main realbot folder
with the rb_insults file which is located in your language.

If your language is not here, and you think it should be included. Please send
me a mail with a translated rb_insults file. The first person who sent a translation
of the 'not included' language will be named here.

NOTE: The dead chat is NOT in a file YET.
