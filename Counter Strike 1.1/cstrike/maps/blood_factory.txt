Blood Factory - eliminate the enemies!
by Kampy (Kampy19@gmx.de)

Counter-Terrorists: 
You start upstairs. There not much to say...
Two ways: through the vent or through the door.

Terrorists: 
You start at the acid-lake! Down fall in it.
If you push the "test fire"-button the bridge
will collapse and an earthquake rumbles.


Other Notes: 
- The lasercannon can be activated by the button above.	
- this was actually a Half-Life map
- have fun, this is pure deathmatch!!
