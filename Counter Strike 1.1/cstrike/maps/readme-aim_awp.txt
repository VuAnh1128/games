hey all, well i just made this map to
improve upon awp_map. i feel awp-map is n00bishly made,
boring, (also boring textures not fun to look at) so, 
i came up with this. Its go bushes, u can hide behind, big
boxes u can hide behind, and also barbed wire in the middle 
which hurts if u walk thru it, so u gota hop over it. Also
a bridge. i think ull really love it as it is
much more realistic and fun than awp_map. 
it has a buyzone, on top of the tall-big box in middle.
well thats bout it, enjoy!
