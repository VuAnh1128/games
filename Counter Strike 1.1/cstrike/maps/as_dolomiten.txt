Dolomiten - Assassination

Instructions CT: The road down to
the valley was bombed! We are 
afraid this could be a striking 
against B.D*censored* and want 
to protect him if this is true. Your 
task is to lead him to the
gondola, which is the only way 
now to reach the valley.

Instructions T: With our first strike
we´ve cutted off the little group from
any civilisation. Henning manipulated
the phone connection, their only
way out is to reach the gondola, so 
they have to use the street. Place
your men wise and use the surprising 
moment to finish this operation, because
we suppose they have no idea that 
bridge was bombed to get Mr. D*censored*.
