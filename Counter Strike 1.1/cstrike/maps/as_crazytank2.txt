CT: You have made it this far, but the
road ahead has too many obstacles for 
the tank to drive through.  With the help
of a chopper, the tank will be air lifted 
through the rest of the chasm.  But the 
tank is too heavy to be lifted out of the 
chasm completely.    

T:  Stop the VIP from surviving the ride
through the chasm at all costs.
