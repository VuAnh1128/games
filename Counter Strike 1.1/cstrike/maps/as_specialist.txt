Background: A terrorist group has stolen a nuclear warhead from
a military base and intends to detonate it in a warehouse
located at the suburb of a great and populous city.

The only one that can disarm the bomb is it's creator (VIP).

Notes: There are two ways to disarm the bomb: through the
laptop stolen by the terrorists next to the warhead, which
contains the disarmament program, or directly in the warhead.

Counter-Terrorists: Protect and scort the V.I.P to one of the
warhead disarm points.

If the mission fails, 20 Million people will die by your failure!

Terrorists: Protect the warhead and don't let anyone use that
pretty laptop... and let the entire city blow!
