The fellowship (CTs) must escort Frodo 
(VIP) through the Dwarf mines of Moria.
-VIP rescue zone is just over the bridge

Ts must kill Frodo and/or the fellowship.

NOTES: 
- THE CTS MUST STICK TOGETHER AND
PROTECT THE VIP, IF YOU DONT YOU ARE AN 
IDIOT!

- I am well aware of the many inaccuracies
that fill this map with shame.
