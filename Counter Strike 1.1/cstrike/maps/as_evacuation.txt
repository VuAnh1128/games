Urban Evacuation - Assassination
by Rainey (RoughRainey@bigpond.com)

Background: Terrorists have organised an 
air-strike to hit this small city, in attemps 
to assassinate a civilian witness to 
a ground breaking murder, before he gives 
his evidence against the deadly criminals.

Counter-Terrorists: Protect the VIP at 
all costs. Escort him to safety before 
the 5 minute deadline hits.

Terrorists: Eliminate the VIP and the 
air-strike will abort.
