Time till finish: 1 week 5 days.


Background:  This is the sequel to cs_soulcity. This time, a year later, the drug addicts are at it again, but intend on killing Mr. Friedrich. The Police have Markus Friedrich(famous handicapped Pianist) in their custody, but the drug addicts have called upon the Dealers to help out. Markus has had a nervous breakdown and wants to commit suicide before those drugies kill him.

Terrorists: See to it that your customers are happy by killing the Piano player any way possible. you need their drug money. Soulcity is too small to loose valuable customers like that.

Counter-Terrorists:  Protect this pianist from an early death...try to guide him to the end of the park, hold that position, and wait for back-up. He's going nuts so try to talk him out of jumping down into the pit in the Bordell's construction site. It's a really long drop.
