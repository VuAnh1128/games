The Ts have located Club Cc while in 
free-float mode.  After spending 5 months 
gloating about how they found it, they 
decided its time to try and get inside it.  
Because they are too stupid to figure out 
the easy way in, or figure out the secret 
way in, they have resorted to decompiling 
the map.  But everyone knows the mental 
anguish and moral sacrifices one must make 
to decompile a map, so the Ts will pay 
dearly for it.

T:  Find a way to get into the club.  You 
can boost teammates over walls, use the bikes 
to get on the club’s roof or you can 
“decompile the map”.  If you choose to 
“decompile” then you better watch out 
for traps!

CT:  Prevent the Ts from planting the bomb 
in your club.
