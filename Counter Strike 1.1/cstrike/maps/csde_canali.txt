Canali - Bomb/Defuse & Hostage rescue
by CMG Lee (cmg_lee@yahoo.com)

Conquer the elements in this Venice-like village:
Land - Conventional warfare over (some) crumbling bridges...
Sea  - The great warrior uses the tide to his/her advantage!
Air  - Roam the village's rooftops, but beware of snipers...
         Rumour has it that 2 deadly weapons await the bold.

Counter-Terrorists:  Defuse bombs that threaten the gas
tanks or lead the 4 hostages to the Hostage Rescue Point.

Terrorists:  Bomb one of the 3 caches of LNG tanks while
preventing Counter-Terrorists from rescuing the hostages.

Advert: Get csde_canelli, the shotgun-pumping version.
